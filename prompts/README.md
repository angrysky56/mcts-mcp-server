# MCTS MCP Server - AI Guidance

This folder contains prompts and guidance for AI assistants on how to effectively use the MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) MCP server tools.

## Overview

The MCTS MCP server provides advanced reasoning capabilities through Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms. It can explore multiple solution paths and find optimal approaches to complex questions.

## Key Tools

1. **initialize_mcts** - Start a new MCTS session
2. **run_mcts_search** - Execute search iterations  
3. **get_synthesis** - Generate final analysis
4. **get_status** - Check current state
5. **list_available_models** - See available LLM models
6. **set_provider** - Change LLM provider

## Quick Start Workflow

1. Initialize with a question
2. Run search iterations
3. Get synthesis of results

See individual prompt files for detailed guidance.
